Use gitbash for running commands, not cmd or powershell.
Do not ask for permission to run npm, npx, or any other npm commands. just run them.
When deleting a file, make sure to use the correct command and ask my permission first.
For example, to delete a file named "example.txt", you would run the command "rm example.txt" in gitbash.
